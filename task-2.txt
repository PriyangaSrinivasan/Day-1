Objects in javascript:
           1. whatever we see like cars, bikes, laptops, and so on. Objects in everyday life have properties
             and "method" actions. For example, a fan is an Object with properties such as making a color and actions 
             it can perform such as cooling rooms and controlling speed. 
           2.Data type and forms the building blocks for modern javascript.
             These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

           3.Properties are characteristics of an object such as its name and value. Objects let you group related data together and split code in logical pieces.
             We have primitive values and reference values.
                  a.Number
                  b.Boolean
                  c.Null
                  d.Undefined
                  e.String and Symbol 
             These are primitive values
           4. You can use objects differently depending on their properties and methods.
             the object has key-value pairs in a javascript object associating each key with a unique value.

           5. Object represents a person with properties like "name", "age", "friends" and a function greet.
             Each property becomes a key-value pair with property value. Both properties and methods are created inside the objects.
            

           6. We can add or change properties without declaring a variable. We start with our preferred name, a colon, and then your value.
              We can create an array inside the object. 

           7.object methods :object property containing a function.
